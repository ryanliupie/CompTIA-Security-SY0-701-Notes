    This is a practice question derived from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODrEjR-DsR0&list=PLTWRAc3irpxFC85HVVfJVEaWp2_P1II9s"> Cyberkraft </a> about firewall rules.

    üõ°Ô∏èIn the first scenario, an IT Admin wants to install a system that can detect malicious activity because the last attack did a lot of damage. The control category for this would be "Techical" because installing a system requires some form of technology. Next, the control type would be "Detective" because we only want it to identify malicious activity like a spy. Lastly, the way we can do this is by "Installing an IDS". We learnt that an IDS only monitors and detects malicious activity but does not take action, therefore, this is the right action to take.

    üõ°Ô∏èIn the second scenario, the CEO wants to implement measures to prevent employees from visiting insecure websites. The control category for this measure would be "Operational," which may be confused with "Managerial." The distinction lies in the focus: operational controls deal with correcting human behavior to prevent unintended or malicious actions on a day-to-day basis. In contrast, managerial controls are designed to govern the organization's overall security posture, ensuring alignment with business objectives and regulatory requirements.

    Furthermore, the control type would be classified as "Deterrent" because, while employees could still access insecure websites, the implemented remediation of creating an "Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)", serves to discourage this behavior and reduce its occurrence.

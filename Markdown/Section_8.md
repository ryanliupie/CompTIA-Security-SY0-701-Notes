    This is a practice question derived from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODrEjR-DsR0&list=PLTWRAc3irpxFC85HVVfJVEaWp2_P1II9s"> Cyberkraft </a> about firewall rules.

<p>
    üõ°Ô∏èIn the first scenario, an IT Admin proposes installing a system to detect malicious activity after a previous attack caused significant damage. The control category for this measure would be "Technical" because it involves deploying technology to address the issue.
</p>
<p> 
    The control type would be "Detective," as the system's purpose is to monitor and identify malicious activity, similar to the role of a spy. This aligns with the goal of detection without immediate intervention.
</p>
<p> 
    To achieve this, the recommended approach is "Installing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)." An IDS is specifically designed to monitor and detect malicious activity but does not take action to prevent or mitigate the threat, making it an appropriate solution in this case.
</p>

<p>
    üõ°Ô∏èIn the second scenario, the CEO wants to implement measures to prevent employees from visiting insecure websites. The control category for this measure would be "Operational," which may be confused with "Managerial." The distinction lies in the focus: operational controls deal with correcting human behavior to prevent unintended or malicious actions on a day-to-day basis. In contrast, managerial controls are designed to govern the organization's overall security posture, ensuring alignment with business objectives and regulatory requirements. 
</p>
<p> 
    Furthermore, the control type would be classified as "Deterrent" because, while employees could still access insecure websites, the implemented remediation of creating an "Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)", serves to discourage this behavior and reduce its occurrence.
</p>

<p>
    üõ°Ô∏èIn the third scenario, the CIO observes that anyone can easily access the server room and wants to evaluate and ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed entry. The control category in this case would be "Managerial," as the focus is on evaluating the situation and establishing a strategic solution, which is a management responsibility.
</p>
<p>
    The control type would be "Preventative" because the goal is to implement measures that block unauthorized access before it occurs. A suitable control remediation would be "Installing Keycard Entry," which restricts access to authorized personnel only, thereby addressing the identified risk.

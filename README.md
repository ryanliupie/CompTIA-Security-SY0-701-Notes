## Jason Dion Practice Exam Tips ⚔️

Before attempting Jason Dion’s practice exams, ensure you have completed your notes and reviewed all course material. Treat each practice exam as if it were the real test. CompTIA questions often assess precision and critical thinking, so approach them seriously and avoid relying on memorization alone. Given the cost of the exam voucher ($437.69 CAD), preparation should be disciplined and intentional.

Take each practice exam once under exam conditions without notes. After completing it, review every incorrect answer and document why your choice was wrong and why the correct answer is right. Focus on understanding the concept rather than memorizing answers.

Next, review the questions you answered correctly. If any were guesses, clarify why the correct option was right and why the others were not.

After completing all exams once, retake them. If you are not consistently scoring near 100%, revisit weaker areas. Mastery means understanding the material well enough to explain acronyms and concepts clearly in your own words.

Finally, identify any knowledge gaps. Consider whether you could confidently answer a question if a specific term appeared unexpectedly. Supplement your preparation with additional resources, such as free practice questions or alternative explanations, to reinforce understanding and close remaining gaps.

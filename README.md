## Jason Dion Practice Exam Tips ‚öîÔ∏è

<p> 
    When taking Jason Dion's Practic exams, make sure you have completed your notes and have gone through all the material. Imagine each practice exam you take, is the real exam. This will help you focus on the material because in my experience, CompTIA exams like to trick you so do not slack off. Also, since this exam was quite expensive, $437.69 CAD to be exact, buying another voucher will definitely hurt the bank a bit. 
</p>
<p>
    The way I did this was by taking each exam once with no material in front of me. After the exam was done, go through all the incorrect answers and write it up in google docs about why it was wrong and what is the correct answer. If you only memorize the correct answer, you are not learning. Once that is done, go through all the correct answers because there will be some of them that you may have guessed. If that's the case, it's best to understand why your guess was correct even if you were deciding on two and chose the other. 
</p>
<p>
    After going through each exam once, take it again. If you are not getting close to 100%, you have not learnt the material enough, hence, you have to review again. Next, make sure you know each acrynomn where you can explain what each one is even if you have not memorized the specific wording.   
</p>

<p>
    Once these exams are done, fill in the gaps. What don't you know that well? If this term were to pop up on the exam, would you be lost? Differentiate your resources by taking free practice exams on YouTube, learn from different people, and even turning a random page in your notes. This will help you fill in the gaps in my experience. 
</p>
<p>
    Finally, take all six practice exams a third time, but now, with more knowledge on the material. If you are getting close to 100%, you have learnt. This not only primes you with knowledge but confidence. Taking these practice exams three times may seem excessive, but as a student, we want to maximize results, while minimizing cost. One might argue that time is of the essence, which is true, but are you willing to manage your time wisely?
